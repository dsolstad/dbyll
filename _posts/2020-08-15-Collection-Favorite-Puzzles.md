I have heard a lot of logical puzzles over the years, and I have now compiled a list of my favorite ones. None of these puzzles has dumb answers, nor do they require a PhD in mathamatics to solve. 
Most of them are probably well known, but I have rewritten them in my own words. If anyone has any input to more cool puzzle, then reach out!
